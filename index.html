  SCELBAL was the first (1974-75) and only open-source, floating-point, BASIC-like language for the 8008, Intel's first 8-bit microprocessor.  
  The purpose of this site is to preserve a machine-executable version of SCELBAL to show what programming an early personal computer was like. 
  Because of the similarity of the 8080 instruction set, SCELBAL was also available for that processor, 
  making SCELBAL the first competitor to Bill Gates and Paul Allen's Altair BASIC.
  The source code of SCELBAL was distributed (1976) in book form (at publication cost, $50) by Scelbi Computer Consulting,
  making it an early example of open-source personal computer software,
  in contrast to the high price charged for the source of Altair BASIC.
  The authors of the book, <i>SCELBAL: A Higher Level Language for 8008/8080 Systems</i>, are 
  the late Nat Wadsworth (founder of Scelbi) and Mark G. Arnold (MGA), who created this site a half-century later.
  Nat wrote the floating-point package (also open-sourced and published separately in <i>Machine Language Programming for the 8008 and Similar Microprocessors</i>); 
  MGA wrote the rest of SCELBAL.

<p> This github site hosts a few variations of an 8008 simulator written in Javascript that run different versions of SCELBAL.  
	The Javascript is a direct transliteration of 
	SCELBAL code that emulates the 8008 (as can be seen by viewing the js source). 
	The link(s) below emulate enough of the 8008 instruction set to run these versions of SCELBAL 
	(the emulator lacks the parity flag and the restart instruction, neither of which SCELBAL needs):

<p>
  <a href="https://scelbal.github.io/scel24.htm"> https://scelbal.github.io/scel24.htm</a> emulates the minimal (8K) published version 
  (with bug patches) that offers floating-point variables, one-dimensional arrays and square root, 
  but does not implement strings or transcendental functions.    
</p>

<p> Some hints:
 
	To start SCELBAL, click the "RUN" button.  The output appears in a js prompt (if more than fits in the js prompt, hitting enter will scroll
	--an artifact of this emulator not the original behavior.)  Normally hitting enter (or clicking OK) will continue interaction with SCELBAL.
	Hitting CANCEL will pause SCELBAL; all the output will have been saved in the CONSOLE OUTPUT).
	Like other software of the era, SCELBAL expects all upper case input (caps locks will make interaction more convienent).
	BASICs of this era use something like the Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) of a modern command-line IDE like Python, just a bit more primative.
	Typing PRINT 2*3+4*5 immediately evaluates the expression and prints the result.
	Prefacing it with a line number saves the statement in memory to be executed in numerical order (unless altered by statements like IF, GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN or FOR/NEXT).
	You can LIST this program or SCR (to scratch it and all workspace variables).
	To save typing, several interesting SCELBAL programs can be selected before starting SCELBAL by clicking on a link; 
	once SCELBAL is running, you can simply type LOAD to bring the program into emulated memory 
	(similar to the LOAD command of that era, which loaded programs from magnetic cassette tape) and the type RUN.
	One of these SCELBAL programs ("sim8") is the 8008 simulator running under SCELBAL 
	(Because the js source was derived from this, it is close to a demonstration of the universality of the 8008 and SCELBAL as a general-purpose computer).
	Others programs: list primes less than 1000; print the Mandelbrot set; compute the gcd; and solve simultanous equations.
