  SCELBAL was the first (1974-75) and only open-source, floating-point (BASIC-like) language for the 8008, Intel's first 8-bit microprocessor.  
  The purpose of this site is to preserve a machine-executable record of what programming an early personal computer was like. 
  Because of the similarity of the 8080 instruction set, SCELBAL was also available for that processor, 
  making SCELBAL the first competitor to Bill Gates and Paul Allen's Altair BASIC.
  The source code was distributed (1976) in book form (at publication cost, $50) by Scelbi Computer Consulting,
  making it an early example of open-source personal computer software,
  in contrast to the high price charged for the source to Altair BASIC.
  The authors of the book, <i>SCELBAL: A Higher Level Language for 8008/8080 Systems</i> are 
  the late Nat Wadsworth (founder of Scelbi) and Mark G. Arnold (MGA), who created this site a half-century later.
  Nat wrote the floating-point package (also open-sourced and published separately in <i>Machine Language Programming for the 8008 and Similar Microprocessors</i>); 
  MGA wrote the rest of SCELBAL.

<p> This github site hosts a few variations of an 8008 simulator written in Javascript that run different versions of SCELBAL.  
 To save typing, several interesting SCELBAL programs 
  can be selected by clicking on a link; once SCELBAL is running, you can simply type LOAD to bring the program into emulated memory 
  (similar to the LOAD command of that era, which loaded programs from magnetic cassette tape).
  The link(s) below emulate enough of the instruction set of Intel's first 8-bit microprocessor, the 8008, to run these versions of SCELBAL:

  <a href="https://scelbal.github.io/scel24.htm"> https://scelbal.github.io/scel24.htm</a> emulates the minimal (8K) published version 
  (with bug patches) that offers floating-point variables, one-dimensional arrays and square root, 
  but does not implement strings or transcendental functions.
